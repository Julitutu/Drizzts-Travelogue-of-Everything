		<description>
			<p>Born from the magic of an awakened mastiff archmage, the mastar are a species of humanoid canines. While most mastar bear the physical traits of one or more larger domestic dog breeds, such as mastiffs or huskies, others can have the traits of smaller dog breeds—or even wolves!</p>
			<p>With a blend of humanoid and canine traits, the mastar often retain one or more of their ancestors’ animalistic instincts, if in a somewhat muted capacity.</p>
			<h4>MASTAR NAMES</h4>
			<p>Mastar names are short, simple, and without fuss. They rarely use surnames, but will often suffix their names in more formal settings by naming themselves as the child of one or both of their parents.</p>
			<p>
			<span class="feature">Male Mastar Names:</span> Barbas, Bear, Cliff, Fen, Garm, Jax, Mo, Pako, Rigby, Rin, Rocco, Tol, Varis<br />
			<span class="feature">Female Mastar Names:</span> Anara, Falda, Fern, Kima, Maru, Meeki, Ney, Pepper, Saru, Sif, Vala, Vivi, Voja
			</p>

			<p>As a bonus action, you can let out a deafening howl to embolden your allies or terrify your enemies. When you do, choose either Frightful Howl or Inspiring Howl. You can use your Canid Howl a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Frightful Howl.</em></strong> Choose a hostile creature that you can see within 60 feet of you. If the target can hear you, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. The DC for this saving throw is 8 + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (you choose when you select this ancestry) + your proficiency bonus. On a failure, the target is frightened of you until the start of your next turn. A creature frightened in this way can still move towards you, but expends 2 feet of movement for every 1-foot it moves.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Inspiring Howl.</em></strong> You and each allied creature within 60 feet of you that can hear you gain temporary hit points equal to twice your proficiency bonus, which last until the start of your next turn.</p>
