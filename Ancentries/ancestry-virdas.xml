			<p>Virdas are sentient, ambulatory plants native to the Feywild, a realm of beauty, unpredictable emotion, and boundless magic. How they came to be is shrouded in mystery. Some claim that they were born from the blood of a powerful Archfey that laid dying alone in the wilds of the realm. Others claim that the magic of the Feywild willed simply them into existence.</p>
			<p>Appearances of virdas vary greatly. Some appear as humanoids made of plant matter, while others look more like traditional plants that move using their roots.</p>
			<h4>IRDAS TRAITS</h4>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Ability Score Increase.</em></strong> Your Wisdom score increases by 2, and your Constitution score increases by 1.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Plant.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this ancestry.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet. You can also pass through nonmagical plants without being slowed by them and without taking damage from them if they have thorns, spines, or a similar hazard. In addition, you have advantage on saving throws against plants that are magically created or manipulated to impede movement, such as those created by the entangle spell.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Hurl Earth.</em></strong> You can use the Attack action to cause an upheaval of earth in a 5-foot-radius sphere centered on a point that you can see within 60 feet of you. If you’re able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one of them. As long as the chosen point is on solid ground and that ground is made from earth, stone, loose dirt or sand, or a similar material, each creature in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw, the DC of which is equal to 8 + your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma modifier (you choose when you select this ancestry) + your proficiency bonus, taking 1d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. This damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8). You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Nature’s Knowledge.</em></strong> You are proficient in the Nature skill. Additionally, you have advantage on Intelligence (Nature) checks made to identify plants and Intelligence (Medicine) checks when using plants as natural remedies.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Photosynthesis.</em></strong> As long as you spend at least 1 hour each day in direct sunlight, you don’t require food. Additionally, as long as a part of your body is exposed to soft, plant-suitable earth for at least 1 hour a day, you don’t require water.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Plant Camouflage.</em></strong> You have advantage on Dexterity (Stealth) checks to hide in forested terrain.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speech of the Leaf.</em></strong> You can communicate with Plant creatures as if you share a language with them.</p>
