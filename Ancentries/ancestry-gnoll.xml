        <description>
           <p>While gnollkind were spawned from the demon lord Yeenoghu, many have long-since broken free from his fell influence and taken up lives of their own. These gnolls often form close-knit communities out in the wilderness, where they survive together in unison. Called packs, these gnoll villages are built on mutual cooperation and trading with other nearby communities.</p>
			<p>Standing well over 7 feet tall, gnolls take after hyenas in both appearance and special capabilities. Their jaws can break through bone and they have a natural instinct for hunting and survival.</p>
			<h4>GNOLL NAMES</h4>
			<p>Gnolls that live under the sway of Yeenoghu are rarely given the luxury of names. This is something those that are free of the demon lord’s foul touch are keen to rectify. Gnolls take great pride in their names, often deriving them from words in Gnoll pertaining to their attunement with nature or their freedom from Yeenoghu.</p>
			<p>Those that live in packs will often use the name of their pack as a surname.</p>
			<p>
			<span class="feature">Gnoll Names:</span> Aargab, Alark, Andak, Ethak, Eyeth, Ignar, Immor, Oduk, Orrom, Otal, Ulthak, Ustar<br />
			<span class="feature">Gnoll Pack Names:</span> Earthpaw, Plainrunner, Quietspear, Stonewalker, Wanderer, Windfree, Woodhome

            <h4>Gnoll Traits</h4>
            <p>As an Gnoll, you have the following racial traits.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Humanoid. You are also considered a Gnoll for any prerequisite or effect that requires you to be a Gnoll.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> Your size is Medium.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your base walking speed is 35 feet.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Darkvision.</em></strong> You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. You discern colors in that darkness only as shades of gray.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Fangs.</em></strong> You have powerful jaws and incredibly sharp teeth that act as natural weapons, which you can use to make unarmed strikes.

            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Wild Intuition.</em></strong> You can communicate simple ideas and thoughts with hyenas when you speak in Gnoll.</p>
            <p class="indent"><strong><em>Languages.</em></strong> You have an instinctive connection to surviving in the wild. You therefore have proficiency in one of the following skills: Animal Handling, Athletics, Intimidation, Perception, or Survival.</p>
