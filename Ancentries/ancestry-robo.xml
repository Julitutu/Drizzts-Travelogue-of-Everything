		<description>
			<p>Famed artificer, Antara, a blue dragonborn from clan Jarrakas, is credited with the creation of the Robos. However, upon their creation, Antara proceeded to spend much of the rest of her life stating she had no idea exactly how she did it. After an innocuous accident involving arcane infusion and her steel defender, Adrex, the construct seemingly gained complete sapience.</p>
			<p>The journeys of this pair: artificer and newly-awakened construct, have passed into legends known to all robos. While only robos with a humanoid assortment of limbs are receptive to whatever strange magic brings life to their minds, they can otherwise take on almost any shape and size.</p>
			<h4>ROBO TRAITS</h4>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Age.</em></strong> Robos are physically mature the moment they are brought online. So far, robos have shown no signs of deterioration due to age. You are immune to magical aging effects.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Creature Type.</em></strong> You are a Construct.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Size.</em></strong> You are Medium or Small. You choose the size when you select this ancestry.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Speed.</em></strong> Your walking speed is 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Constructed Nature.</em></strong> You have resistance to poison damage and immunity to disease, and you have advantage on saving throws against being paralyzed or poisoned. You don’t need to eat, drink, or breathe.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Mechanical Marvel.</em></strong> Your body was designed with one or more special capabilities. You have one of the following traits.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Sentry’s Rest.</em></strong> When you take a long rest, you spend at least 6 hours in an inactive, motionless state, instead of sleeping. In this state, you appear inert, but you remain conscious.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Specialized Design.</em></strong> You gain one tool proficiency of your choice.</p>
			<p class="indent"><strong><em>Soulful Construct.</em></strong> You benefit from several spells that preserve life but that normally don’t affect Constructs: reincarnate, spare the dying, and any spell that restores hit points to the target or similar magic.</p>
