			<p>Those who practice the weaving of the performing arts with magic aren’t always singers or storytellers, nor are they always poets or painters. Sometimes they dance. For those inclined to sashay across the dance floor, it is often less important to be better than everyone else at the dance than it is to be better than yourself.</p>
			<p class="indent">Although it should be noted that—for some— being better than everyone else has its own rewards. Members of the College of the Promenade are often as at home in the courts of nobles with masques and music and the pervasive fear of a metaphorical knife in the back as they are in the grassy meadow of a peasant folk festival.</p>

When you grant a creature a Bardic Inspiration die, that creature can choose another creature within 5 feet of it to share its inspiration. This second creature gains a Bardic Inspiration die identical to the first. This second die does not cost you an additional use of your Bardic Inspiration.</p>
