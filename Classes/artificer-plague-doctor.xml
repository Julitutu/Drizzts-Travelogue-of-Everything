			<p>Every human generation or so, there is a pandemic of some kind of mundane disease somewhere along the Sword Coast. While magic and those who follow the gods can provide healing, their services can be expensive. And even when a temple’s services are free of charge, the plagues can often spread faster than magic can contain it. In many of these circumstances, special doctors fill in the gaps where faith fails. Plague doctors practice a form of artifice that—while similar to herbalism and alchemy—is inherently different. While these artificers often go by different names, be it medicinalists, pharmacists, apothecaries, or chemists; the moniker of plague doctor is used by the layman near-ubiquitously.</p>
