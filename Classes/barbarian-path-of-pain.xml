			<p>Your hardened body and mind allows you to withstand incoming assault with far greater ease than most.

			<p class="indent">When you deal damage to a hostile creature with a melee weapon attack, if your Resilience Meter has 1 or more hit points, you may spend a number of hit points from your Resilience Meter up to an amount equal to the damage dealt, or the amount of hit points left in your Resilience Meter, whichever is lower. If you do, you regain that many hit points.</p>
			<p class="indent">Your Resilience Meter has a hit point maximum equal to your barbarian level + your proficiency bonus.</p>
