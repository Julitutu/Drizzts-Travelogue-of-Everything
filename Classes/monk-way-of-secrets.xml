			<p>Those who follow the Way of Secrets are erudite sages who hold great knowledge and hidden truths. These monks seek to expand their understanding of themselves and the world around them, keeping such secrets from the hands of those that would misuse them. They utilize the hidden techniques and martial practices they have unearthed from teachings long-forgotten to protect the secrets they hold.</p>
			<p class="indent">Despite their boundless knowledge, Monks of the Way of Secrets appear as little more than ascetic hermits to most, but a sharp, well-learned soul can spot a wizened stare in their eyes.</p>

			<p class="indent"><b>Secrets of the Body.</b> Whenever you hit a creature with two attacks granted by your Flurry of Blows feature on a turn, you regain hit points equal to your Wisdom modifier + your monk level.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Secrets of the Mind.</b> The first time you miss a creature with an attack granted by your Flurry of Blows feature on a turn, you may roll and add your Martial Arts die to the result, potentially turning the miss into a hit.</p>
			<p class="indent"><b>Secrets of the Soul.</b> The first time you hit a creature with an attack granted by your Flurry of Blows feature on a turn, the target suffers disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until the start of your next turn.</p>
