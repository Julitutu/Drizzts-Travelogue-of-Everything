			<p>While bards are famed for their moving music, compelling rhetoric, and powerful poetry, many bards instead choose to pursue the visual arts. Bards of the College of Colors are masterful painters and illustrators, weaving fantastic magics into their craft. When the College of Colors wields a color, magic is guaranteed to follow.</p>
			<p class="indent">The world is a canvas for these bards, and each one is eager to create their own masterpiece.</p>

			<p>You paint your magic into being, rather than simply speaking words and making gestures. You can use painter’s supplies as a spellcasting focus for your bard spells. While you have painter’s supplies in hand, you ignore the verbal components of bard spells you cast, painting them into being.</p>
			<p class="indent">Additionally, you learn the minor illusion cantrip, which doesn’t count against the number of bard cantrips you know. When you cast minor illusion while you have painter’s supplies in hand and choose to create an image of an object, the illusion can be up to a 10-foot cube and the spell lasts for 24 hours.</p>

		<description>
			<p>You can harness color magic, painting the world in all the colors of the rainbow. You can use a bonus action to expend one use of your Bardic Inspiration and roll on the Color Magic table to determine the color that best compliments the battle. You retain the color’s power until you invoke the color’s effect or you finish a short or long rest.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can use an action to invoke the effect of your stored color, painting it into the world. Choose a number of points up to twice your proficiency bonus that you can see within 60 feet of you. You create a 5-foot cube of magic representing the chosen color’s effects centered on each of the chosen points. Each 5-foot cube you create this way must be adjacent to at least one other cube. The color magic lasts for 1 minute, after which it vanishes in a flash of colored light. Once you paint a stored color, you can’t invoke the color’s effect again until you roll it again.</p>
			<p class="indent">You can store only one of these colors at a time, and rolling on the Color Magic table immediately ends the effect of the previous color.</p>
			<p class="indent">If the color requires a saving throw, the DC equals your bard spell save DC.</p>

					<tr><td>d8</td><td>Color</td><td>Invoked</td></tr>
				</thead>
				<tr><td>1</td><td>Red</td><td>You paint a grand battlefield, causing the affected areas to become bastions of burning resolve. When you create the areas, you may designate any number of creatures. Whenever a designated creature hits a hostile creature with an attack roll while in an affected area for the first time on a turn, the target of the attack takes extra fire damage equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>2</td><td>Orange</td><td>You paint a scene of radiant light, causing the affected areas to become places of healing and protection. When you create the areas, you may designate any number of creatures. Designated creatures in affected areas automatically succeed on death saving throws, and whenever a designated creature in an affected area regains hit points from a spell of 1st-level or higher, that creature regains additional hit points equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration die. Additionally, whenever a creature you did not designate enters an affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must succeed on a Constitution saving throw or become blinded until the end of the turn.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>3</td><td>Yellow</td><td>You paint dark clouds, crackling with bolts of lightning. Whenever a creature enters an affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failure, roll your Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus. A creature takes lightning damage equal to the result. A creature that takes damage in this way can’t take reactions until the start of its next turn.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>4</td><td>Green</td><td>You paint luscious greenery, causing each affected area to become heavily obscured with plant matter for the duration. Additionally, a creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>5</td><td>Blue</td><td>You paint a roiling ocean of unkind waters, causing the affected area to become filled with churning seawater. Whenever a creature enters an affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength saving throw. On a failure, roll your Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to half your proficiency bonus. A creature takes cold damage equal to the result. A creature that takes damage in this way is pushed up to 10 feet in a direction you choose that is horizontal to you.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>6</td><td>Indigo</td><td>You paint joyous scenes of mirth and merry, causing each affected area to become a haven of protection. When you create the areas, you may designate any number of creatures. Whenever a designated creature enters an affected area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it gains temporary hit points equal to a roll of your Bardic Inspiration dice + your proficiency bonus. While a creature has these temporary hit points, it gains a +1 bonus to AC.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>7</td><td>Violet</td><td>You paint a scene evoking grandiose arcane mysticism. Each affected area becomes filled with a solid 5-foot cube of magical force. If the cube occupies the space of a Large or smaller creature when it appears, that creature is pushed 5 feet away from the wall in a direction you choose. Roll your Bardic Inspiration die a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. Each cube has AC equal to your bard spell save DC and hit points equal to the result, as well as resistance to force damage and immunity to poison and psychic damage.</td></tr>
				<tr><td>8</td><td>Black and White</td><td>You paint an ideal representation of balance. When you create the areas, you may designate any number of creatures. Designated creatures in affected areas get a +2 bonus to AC. Creatures you didn’t designate in affected areas get a -2 penalty to AC.</td></tr>
