			<p>Monks who follow the Way of Terror learn to manipulate the hearts and minds of their enemies, executing brutal techniques to stoke primal fear in those they face in combat.</p>
			<p class="indent">Intimidation and force come naturally to these warriors, for good or for ill. Some who follow the Way of Terror use its techniques to bully and belittle the innocent, ruling by force and taking what they can claim. Others, however, turn its techniques against those who do evil—lurking in the night to find and punish those who prey on the weak.</p>
