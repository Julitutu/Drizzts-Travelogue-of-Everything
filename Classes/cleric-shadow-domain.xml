			<p>Where there is light there is also shadow, and that is where clerics of the Shadow Domain reside. These clerics are experts of all that is cultivated in the dark. Some may find the monsters and powers of the night frightening, but Shadow Domain clerics wield these powers against anyone who would threaten the balance of light and dark.</p>
			<p class="indent">Examples of deities of shadow include Anubis, Lolth, Mask, the Raven Queen, Set, Shar, Takhisis, and Torog.</p>
