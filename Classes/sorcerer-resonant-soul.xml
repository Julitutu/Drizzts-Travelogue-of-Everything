			<p>Your innate magic comes from the resonance of the universe itself, as it hums softly in tune with your very soul. Those with this magic may trace it to an event of universal significance. Perhaps you were born at the same time as a distant star, or maybe a wave of powerful energy washed over you in your youth, entwining your frequency to the world.</p>
			<p class="indent">A Resonant Soul can wield destructive power by entwining their frequency with other creatures and objects to amplify the potency of their damaging magic. The sway of this power can carry great weight on its user, subtly changing them. At your option, you can pick from or roll on the Resonant Soul Sorcerer Quirks table to create a quirk for your character.</p>

			<p>You gain the ability to tune yourself with another creature’s natural frequency, allowing your spells to impact that creature with greater force. As a bonus action, choose a creature you can see within 30 feet of you to become a resonant creature. The first time each turn that you cast a spell of 1st level or higher using a spell slot that deals damage to a resonant creature, that creature takes extra thunder damage. The extra damage is 1d6 for a 1st-level spell slot, plus 1d6 for every two slot levels higher than 1st, to a maximum of 3d6.</p>
			<p class="indent">The target remains resonant for 1 minute, until you are incapacitated, or until you die.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you use this feature, you can’t use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>

			<p>As a bonus action, you alter the vibrations in a 30-foot sphere centered on a point that you can see within 60 feet of you, which lasts for 1 minute. When you create this sphere you may designate any number of creatures you can see, those creatures gain resistance to thunder damage while they are within the sphere. Other creatures that are in the sphere’s area must make a Constitution saving throw against your sorcerer spell save DC whenever they enter the area for the first time on a turn or start their turn there. On a failure, a creature takes thunder damage equal to half your sorcerer level and if it’s concentrating, it loses concentration. On a success, a creature takes half as much damage and its concentration is unaffected.</p>
			<p class="indent">Once you have used this feature, you must finish a long rest before you may do so again, unless you spend 3 sorcery points to use it again.</p>
